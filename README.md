# EKey-Hardware
Hardware repo for our CS196 Project.

Please use the branch named after your username, and submit pull requests to master which everyone has to review before being approved. DON'T PUSH TO MASTER!
To set this up, right after you git clone:
- git checkout (your branch) ; so I did git checkout jparisferrer
- git branch -u origin/(your branch); so I did git branch -u origin/jparisferrer

Now you can git push and it will push to your branch on github. To merge into master, go to the repo on github.com, submit the PR with master as base and your branch as the other one. Once everyone has left a comment on the PR saying they approve, it can be merged in. Otherwise, it will be closed until the changes are made.
